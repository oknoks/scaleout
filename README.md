## About Scaleout

Company Overview:  
Scaleout is a deep tech company originating from Uppsala University. We specialize in federated machine learning solutions that help organizations create powerful AI models while ensuring data privacy and security.

What Your Company Does:  
Scaleout offer FEDn, a complete federated machine learning framework that allows for easy development and deployment of collaborative AI applications. Our platform supports the entire innovation process, from local proof-of-concept to large-scale distributed implementations, enabling organizations to develop and deploy AI models without risking data security.

Mission Statement:  
Scaleout's goal is to make AI accessible and secure for organizations of all sizes, bringing intelligence to every device and enabling secure, scalable AI from the cloud to the edge, while keeping your data safe.

Problem Statement:  
Traditional centralized AI development requires organizations to gather sensitive data in one place, leading to privacy, security, and regulatory issues. We solve this with federated machine learning, which allows AI training on distributed data without moving it.

One sentence:  
Scaleout delivers federated learning solutions, enabling organizations across industries to develop and deploy collaborative AI models that bring intelligence to every device, from cloud to edge, while keeping sensitive data secure and local.

## Market overview 
Federated learning is considered to be a cornerstone technology in Edge AI, a rapidly growing field that combines artificial intelligence with edge computing.

Three sectors stand out and represents a significant and rapidly growing opportunity:

- The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) market is experiencing robust growth as manufacturers and industrial companies embrace digital transformation. Expected to reach $1.1 trillion (CAGR 22.8%) by 2028, with a significant amount requiring secure, distributed AI solutions. Key drivers include increasing adoption of cloud computing platforms, growing need for predictive maintenance, rising demand for process automation and efficiency, integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

- Artificial intelligence is a foundation for the next-generation transport in the automotive industry, enabling advancements in autonomous vehicles, driver assistance systems, and connected car technologies. Projected to grow to $7 billion by 2027 (CAGR of 20.4%). Key Applications are advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), autonomous vehicles, predictive maintenance, in-car virtual assistants, manufacturing and supply chain optimisation.

- The defence and security sector is increasingly relying on advanced technologies to address evolving threats and enhance operational capabilities. The dual-use AI market in defence is estimated to reach $43.4 billion by 2031, with strong growth expected in secure AI applications. Key Areas are cybersecurity solutions, AI-powered threat intelligence, autonomous systems and robotics, command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems.

**Market Drivers**  
- Increasing demand for real-time processing and lower latency in edge computing.  
- 75% of data will be processed outside centralized facilities in 2025.
- Exponential growth in distributed data sources requiring local processing
- 5G technology will enhance Edge AI with fast, low-latency connections.  
- Stricter data privacy regulations and security needs.
- Integration of ML for improved decision-making and automation.
- Growing demand for collaborative AI development across organizational boundaries.


## Unique value proposition
Our unique strength lies in FEDn's seamless development-to-deployment capability, allowing organizations to develop federated learning applications locally and deploy them at scale without code modifications. This significantly reduces the complexity and risk typically associated with federated learning implementations.

Our competitive advantages stem from three key factors:

- Technical Innovation: Our framework uniquely combines open-source flexibility with enterprise-grade features, supported by deep research collaboration with Uppsala University.
- Cross-Industry Expertise: Our team brings both academic excellence and industry experience from leading tech companies, enabling us to bridge the gap between theoretical federated learning and practical implementation challenges.
- Full-Stack Solution: Unlike competitors who focus on either open-source tools or enterprise platforms, we provide a complete ecosystem from development SDK to production-ready enterprise solution, enabling a smooth transition from proof-of-concept to full-scale deployment.

## Other

Scaleout is at the forefront of two major trends: the demand for privacy-focused AI and the move towards edge computing. Our federated learning solution meets a vital market need in billion-dollar industries like IIoT, Automotive, and Defense due to strict data regulations and privacy concerns.

Our full-stack solution merges open-source flexibility with enterprise strength, supported by collaboration with Uppsala University. Unlike competitors with limited offerings, FEDn delivers a complete development-to-deployment process proven in real-world scenarios.

Our team blends top technical talent from major companies (Google, SAAB, BCG) with extensive academic expertise in machine learning. We have a strong track record of successfully developing and deploying our technology across various sectors while forming solid industry partnerships.
